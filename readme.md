# Epic Fight Battle Styles
#### Everyone is unique. No exceptions. Therefore, let's make it so.

### Mod Focus
This mod focuses on adding generic weapon capabilities to the game, allowing for more unique and interesting weapons to be created. This mod is not intended to add a lot of weapons, but rather a framework for other mods to use to add their own weapons that are compatible with Epic Fight.

### Usage and Weapon Capabilities

| Capability | Description                                                                                                                       |
|--- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|'epic_fight_battle_styles:chakram' | A throwing weapon that recurves back to you.                                                                                      |
|'epic_fight_battle_styles:sword' | Essentially the same as the original epicfight:sword capability. But with some patches to allow the integration of battle styles. |
|'epic_fight_battle_styles:longsword' | Same description as above but with longswords.                                                                                    |
|'epic_fight_battle_styles:rapier| A thrusting sword.                                                                                                                |
Note: The above capabilities are also applied to 1.19.2 and 1.18.2 respectively, so you cannot put 'chakram' or 'sword'. It must be 'epic_fight_battle_styles:chakram' or 'epic_fight_battle_styles:sword'. This was made to prevent conflicts with other mods that may add the same capabilities.
### Battle Styles
