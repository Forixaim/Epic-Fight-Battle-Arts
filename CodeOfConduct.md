# Trick Weapons Code of Conduct

When submitting pull requests of new animations, I will assume you have not plagarized anything but keep the username on who has submitted the animations. When a plagarism request is heard from me I will notify the requester on who has submitted the animation files.

Submitted items will NOT be accepted since I plan to keep this mod bare-bones and add only weapon capabilities. If you have created a weapon capability, you can send a pull request to this repository.

Need help creating weapon attack cycles? Let me know. I'm active on Epic Fight Discord and will gladly help you get things implemented, don't be afraid to ping when I'm online.
