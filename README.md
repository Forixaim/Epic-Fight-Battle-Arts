# Trick-Weapons
Getting tricky with generics!

## Mod Focus
This mod focuses on adding no items, merely weapons capabilities and new weapon categories to help other mods to expand on their compatibility with Epic Fight with their generic weapons.

Currently this mod has implemented the Chakram, a lightweight throwing weapon that has incredible reach but can miss on close range targets.

## Contributing
Source code is available for GPL 3.0 use, you can contribute animations, add weapon capabilities, skills, and other neat additions. If you need help on programming, I'm available by contact on Discord.
